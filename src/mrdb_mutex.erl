%% We use a gen_server-based FIFO queue (one queue per alias) to manage the
%% critical section.
%%
%% Releasing the resource is done by notifying the server.
%%
%% Previous implementations tested:
%% * A counter (in ets), incremented atomically first with 0, then 1. This lets
%%   the caller know if the 'semaphore' was 1 or zero before. If it was already
%%   1, busy-loop over the counter until it reads as a transition from 0 to 1.
%%   This is a pretty simple implementation, but it lacks ordering, and appeared
%%   to sometimes lead to starvation.
%% * A duplicate_bag ets table: These are defined such that insertion order is
%%   preserved. Thus, they can serve as a mutex with FIFO characteristics.
%%   Unfortunately, performance plummeted when tested with > 25 concurrent
%%   processes. While this is likely a very high number, given that we're talking
%%   about contention in a system using optimistic concurrency, it's never good
%%   if performance falls off a cliff.
